# Souls like Inventory and Equipment System 

This project's main aim was to implement the Souls Inventory and Equipment System.

The whole User Interface design and its gameplay functionality were copied from Elden Ring. This Inventory system is also closely tied with the Player Character displaying its attributes and reacting to them changing.
